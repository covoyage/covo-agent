# Authoring Skills (in-repo)

## Overview

There are two places a SKILL.md can live:

1. **User-local:** `~/.covo-agent/skills/<maybe-category>/<name>/SKILL.md` — personal, not shared. Created via `skill_manage(action='create')`.
2. **In-repo (this skill is about this case):** Committed, shipped with the package. Use `write` + `git add`. `skill_manage(action='create')` does NOT target this tree.

## When to Use

- User asks you to add a skill "in this branch / repo / commit"
- You're committing a reusable workflow that should ship with covo-agent
- You're editing an existing skill (use `skill_manage(action='patch')` for small edits, `write` for rewrites)

## Required Frontmatter

Hard requirements:

- Starts with `---` as the first bytes (no leading blank line).
- Closes with `\n---\n` before the body.
- Parses as a YAML mapping.
- `name` field present.
- `description` field present, ≤ **1024 chars**.
- Non-empty body after the closing `---`.

Peer-matched shape used by every skill:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name               # lowercase, hyphens, ≤64 chars
description: Use when <trigger>. <one-line behavior>.
version: 1.0.0
author: Covo Agent
license: MIT
metadata:
  tags: [short, descriptive, tags]
  related_skills: [other-skill, another-skill]
---
```

`version` / `author` / `license` / `metadata` are NOT enforced by the validator, but every peer has them — omit and your skill sticks out.

## Size Limits

- Description: ≤ 1024 chars (enforced).
- Full SKILL.md: ≤ 100,000 chars (~36k tokens).
- Peer skills sit at **8-14k chars**. Aim for that range. If you're pushing past 20k, split into `references/*.md` and reference them from SKILL.md.

## Peer-Matched Structure

Every skill follows roughly:

```
# <Title>

## Overview
One or two paragraphs: what and why.

## When to Use
- Bulleted triggers
- "Don't use for:" counter-triggers

## <Topic sections specific to the skill>
- Quick-reference tables are common
- Code blocks with exact commands
- Tool-specific recipes

## Common Pitfalls
Numbered list of mistakes and their fixes.

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Checkbox list of post-action verifications

## One-Shot Recipes (optional)
Named scenarios → concrete command sequences.
```

Not every section is mandatory, but `Overview` + `When to Use` + actionable body + pitfalls are the minimum for the skill to feel like a peer.

## Directory Placement

```
skills/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

Pick the closest existing category. Don't invent new top-level categories casually.

## Workflow

1. **Survey peers** in the target category:
   ```
   ls skills/<category>/
   ```
   Read 2-3 peer SKILL.md files to match tone and structure.
2. **Draft** with `write` to `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md`.
3. **Validate locally**:
   ```python
   import yaml, re, pathlib
   content = pathlib.Path("skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md").read_text()
   assert content.startswith("---")
   m = re.search(r'\n---\s*\n', content[3:])
   fm = yaml.safe_load(content[3:m.start()+3])
   assert "name" in fm and "description" in fm
   assert len(fm["description"]) <= 1024
   assert len(content) <= 100_000
   ```
4. **Git add + commit** on the active branch.
5. **Note:** the CURRENT session's skill loader is cached — `skill_view` / `skills_list` will not see the new skill until a new session. This is expected, not a bug.

## Cross-Referencing Other Skills

`metadata.related_skills` unions both trees at load time. You CAN reference a user-local skill from an in-repo skill, but it won't resolve for other users who clone the repo fresh. Prefer referencing only in-repo skills from in-repo skills.

## Editing Existing Skills

- **Small fix (typo, added pitfall, tightened trigger):** `skill_manage(action='patch', name=..., old_string=..., new_string=...)` works fine.
- **Major rewrite:** `write` the whole SKILL.md. `skill_manage(action='edit')` also works but requires supplying the full new content.
- **Adding supporting files:** `write` to `skills/<category>/<name>/references/<file>.md`, `templates/<file>`, or `scripts/<file>`. `skill_manage(action='write_file')` also works and enforces the references/templates/scripts/assets subdir allowlist.
- **Always commit** the edit — in-repo skills are source, not runtime state.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Using `skill_manage(action='create')` for an in-repo skill.** It writes to `~/.covo-agent/skills/`, not the repo tree. Use `write` for in-repo creation.

2. **Leading whitespace before `---`.** The validator checks `content.startswith("---")`; any leading blank line or BOM fails validation.

3. **Description too generic.** Peer descriptions start with "Use when ..." and describe the *trigger class*, not the one task. "Use when debugging X" > "Debug X".

4. **Forgetting the author/license/metadata block.** Not validator-enforced, but every peer has it; omitting makes the skill look half-finished.

5. **Writing a skill that duplicates a peer.** Before creating, `ls skills/<category>/` and open 2-3 peers. Prefer extending an existing skill to creating a narrow sibling.

6. **Expecting the current session to see the new skill.** It won't. The skill loader is initialized at session start. Verify in a fresh session or via `skill_view` using the exact path.

7. **Linking to skills that don't exist in-repo.** `related_skills: [some-user-local-skill]` works for you but breaks for other clones. Prefer only in-repo links.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] File is at `skills/<category>/<name>/SKILL.md` (not in `~/.covo-agent/skills/`)
- [ ] Frontmatter starts at byte 0 with `---`, closes with `\n---\n`
- [ ] `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `metadata.{tags, related_skills}` all present
- [ ] Name ≤ 64 chars, lowercase + hyphens
- [ ] Description ≤ 1024 chars and starts with "Use when ..."
- [ ] Total file ≤ 100,000 chars (aim for 8-15k)
- [ ] Structure: `# Title` → `## Overview` → `## When to Use` → body → `## Common Pitfalls` → `## Verification Checklist`
- [ ] `related_skills` references resolve in-repo (or are explicitly OK to be user-local)
- [ ] `git add skills/<category>/<name>/ && git commit` completed on the intended branch
